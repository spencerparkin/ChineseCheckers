		<p>
		Welcome to my project page for Chinese Checkers.  For a history of the game,
		see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_checkers">the wiki page</a>.
		This site concerns itself with details about how to use the program.  So without
		any further delay, let's get started.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Hosting a Game</h2>
		
		<p>
		When the program is invoked, the application window appears as shown below.
		</p>
		
		<center><img src="ProgramStartup.jpg"/></center>

		<p>
		As you can see, the screen is blank, but that's because we haven't joined
		a game yet.  But before we can do that, there must be a game for us to join.
		If we know there is already a game being hosted somewhere on the network,
		we can go ahead an connect to that game (see "Joining a Game" below); but if there isn't one, we can go
		ahead and host one ourselves.  To do that, select the "Host Game" option of
		the "Game" menu as shown below.
		</p>
		
		<center><img src="HostGameOption.jpg"/></center>
		
		<p>
		Upon doing so, you are presented with a dialog box that asks you which colors
		will participate in the game.  Anywhere from 2 to 6 participants can play a game.
		</p>
		
		<center><img src="ParticipantsDialog.jpg"/></center>
		
		<p>
		The next dialog box asks you to specify the port number upon which the game
		server will listen for incoming connections from prospective clients.  Choose
		an unused service number.  The IP address of the server hosting the game will
		be that of the computer upon which you are starting the server.
		</p>
		
		<center><img src="ChoosePortDialog.jpg"/></center>
		
		<p>
		If all goes well, you'll then receive the following message box.
		</p>
		
		<center><img src="ServerInitSuccessDialog.jpg"/></center>
		
		<p>
		Upon dissmisal of this message box, no game board appears, but that's okay.
		You have to join a game first before you can begin to play it, remember?
		So let's now talk about joining a hosted game.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Joining a Game</h2>
		
		<p>
		To join a game in progress somewhere on the network, begin by selecting the "Join Game"
		option from the "Game" menu, as shown below.
		
		<center><img src="JoinGameOption.jpg"/></center>
		
		<p>
		Once chosen, the program asks you for the IP address and port number of the
		machine that is hosting the game.  Enter this information in the format of
		the presented default, which is that of the machine you're currently on.
		</p>
		
		<center><img src="EnterAddressOfHostDialog.jpg"/></center>
		
		<p>
		Next, tell the program how you want to join the game.  Do you want to join
		as a human or computer client?
		</p>
		
		<center><img src="ChooseClientTypeDialog.jpg"/></center>
		
		<p>
		As a human client, you have control of the
		client when it's your turn to move your pieces along the game board.  As a computer
		client, the computer will make those types of decisions for you.  The option to
		join as a computer player lets you add more players to the game than you would
		otherwise have in cases where, for example, you need or want a third or fourth
		player, but don't have one.  Similarly, if you want to play the game, but don't
		have someone to play it with, you can play against the computer by setting up a
		2-player game pitting yourself against the computer.  At the time of this writing,
		the computer isn't that smart, but should none-the-less be able to play the game,
		and maybe even win, (if you let it.)
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Finally, if all goes well, you will be presented with the game board and be ready
		to play the game when it's your turn.
		</p>

		<h2>Playing the Game</h2>
		
		<p>
		This game is very easy to play.  The first thing to know is that you should
		keep an eye on the status bar.  It will tell you who's turn it is at all times,
		and therefore, when it's your turn to move your pieces along the board.
		At any time, (whether or not it's your turn), you can click and drag with the
		right mouse button in the main area of the window to orient the board.
		Use the mouse wheel to zoom the board in and out.  Right-click on game pieces
		to select them.  When it's your turn, the only pieces you'll be able to move
		are those of the color to which you have been assigned by the game server.
		(The status bar lets you know what color you are.)
		</p>
		
		<p>
		So how do you play this game?  Well, the objective is to get your pieces to
		the opposite side of the board before any of your opponants.  Each color has
		10 pieces, and beings in the zone of that color.  Blue is trying to get to
		the cyan zone, (and vice-versa), green to the magenta zone, (and vice-versa),
		and red to the yellow zone, (and vice-versa).  Once all of your pieces occupy
		the target zone before anyone else, you win!  In the following example, blue has won the game.
		</p>

		<p>
		Now comes the part about legal moves.
		When it's your turn, you can move any one of your pieces to an empty location on
		the board, provided 1) that location is immediately adjacent to the moving piece's current
		location, or 2) that location can be reached by one or more jumps over immediately
		adjacent pieces of any color at each step.  To make a move, highlight the piece
		you want by right-clicking on it with the mouse, then right-click on the empty board
		location to which you want to move it.  If you've chosen a valid move, (and if
		it's your turn), that move will be made, and it will become the next player's turn.
