		<p>
		Welcome to my project page for Chinese Checkers.  For a history of the game,
		see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_checkers">the wiki page</a>.
		This site concerns itself with details about how to use the program.  So without
		any further delay, let's get started.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Hosting a Game</h2>
		
		<p>
		When the program is invoked, the application window appears as shown below.
		</p>

		<p>
		As you can see, the screen is blank, but that's because we haven't joined
		a game yet.  But before we can do that, there must be a game for us to join.
		If we know there is already a game being hosted somewhere on the network,
		we can go ahead an connect to that game, but if there isn't one, we can go
		ahead and host one ourselves.  To do that, select the "Host Game" option of
		the "Game" menu as shown below.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Upon doing so, you are presented with a dialog box that asks you which colors
		will participate in the game.  Anywhere from 2 to 6 participants can play a game.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The next dialog box asks you to specify the port number upon which the game
		server will listen for incoming connections from prospective clients.  Choose
		an unused service number.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		If all goes well, you'll then receive the following message box.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Upon dissmisal of this message box, no game board appears, but that's okay.
		You have to join a game first before you can begin to play it, remember?
		So let's now talk about joining a hosted game.
