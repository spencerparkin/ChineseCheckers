 -- The AI client needs improvement.  Keep existing AI client and add a better one.
    The user can then select from "computer (easy)" or "computer (hard)".
	
 -- Actually test the program over a real network.  I have only tested the program
    on the loop-back device.

 -- I've noticed the following bug.  Setup two human players playing a game.  Have
    one of them leave; the one who's turn it is.  The other waits for another player
    to join.  Have a computer player join.  Now it's the computer's turn, but they
    won't make their move and you can't do it for them.  The game is in a non-
    progression state.

 -- You can't restart a server after 1 game is played.  Crash!
