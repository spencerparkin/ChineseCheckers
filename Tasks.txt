 -- Actually test the program over a real network.  I have only tested the program
    on the loop-back device.

 -- Sometimes a server fails to start as if the port is till being used.

 -- I had a computer client drop, then a human join in its place.  Then all other
    computer clients didn't wait for any animations to finish before taking their turns.

Note: I've discovered one sneek stratagy against the computer in the case that you are
      playing in adjacent home-zones.  Being adjacent, the target zones are adjacent too.
      So, what you can do is put a marble in one of the computer's target zone locations.
      This prevents the computer from being able to win until you move that marble out.
      If you set things up right, you can ensure a win.  At least, in some cases.
